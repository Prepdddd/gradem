# Rate My Professor Site

This is a simple static website to rate schools and professors, inspired by "Rate My Professor." It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

```
/
|-- index.html
|-- school.html
|-- css/
|   |-- styles.css
|-- js/
|   |-- main.js
|   |-- data.js
|-- README.md
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site.

Currently, the site uses static data defined in `js/data.js`. Reviews and comments are not saved; they are for demonstration purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a backend to store and retrieve real reviews.
- Add authentication for administrators to approve reviews.
- Improve the user interface and add more features.
